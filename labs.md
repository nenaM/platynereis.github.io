### [Williams lab](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Elizabeth_Williams), *University of Exeter (United Kingdom)*
Research in my lab focuses on understanding metamorphosis in marine invertebrate larvae. We primarily use *Platynereis* as a lab model. 


Our research has three main areas of investigation: 

- identification of environmental cues for larval settlement and metamorphosis 
- morphology and physiology of larval sensory systems  
- molecular signaling pathways for metamorphosis
